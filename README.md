I have made implemented CRUD operations using Webforms in .NET, and Entity Framework, and for the database, I have used "MS SQL Server".

I have implemented these 7 features within my application:
1) Apply Leave (CREATE0)
2) View Leave Requests (READ)
3) Approve / Reject Leave (UPDATE)
4) Cancel Leave (DELETE – Soft Delete)
5) Business Rules & Validation
6) Reporting (READ + LINQ)
